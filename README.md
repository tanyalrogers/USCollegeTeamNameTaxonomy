# Database of U.S. College Team Names
This file contains 1,517 team names from 1,510 U.S. colleges, along with location information and (for animals) taxonomic and trophic classifications. The categorizations within the people and other categories are somewhat subjective and/or based on best guesses. 
See [this blog post](https://outsidethequadrat.weebly.com/blog/a-taxonomic-analysis-of-us-college-team-names) for more information.
I compiled this in 2016 using information on Wikipedia, so it is possible some of the data might be outdated or incorrect.
